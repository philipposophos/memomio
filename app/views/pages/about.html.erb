    <div class="about-img-card" style="margin-top: 20px;">
      <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
        Welcome to MemoMio, an application developed by Philipp St√§hr, Paulyn Ompico,
        Leonardo Genzolini, and Florent Theroude.
        We are four Fullstack Web Development students at <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/">Le Wagon</a> Online,
        with a mission to help people doing psychotherapy explore their biography
        in a light and playful way.
        We understand that psychotherapy can be emotionally challenging,
        especially when it comes to revisiting difficult memories.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
        With MemoMio, we aim to provide psychotherapy patients with a digital tool
        that can assist them in structuring, revisiting, and making notes on their memories.
        Our application allows patients to see their memories in context,
        organized in a timeline with other memories and storylines,
        in a visually light and playful digital environment.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
        We believe that our app can help patients reconstruct their own biography
        in a more manageable and less emotionally exhausting way.
        Patients are encouraged to create, curate and make notes on their specific memories,
        adding to or rewriting them as their perspectives change.
        With time, patients can explore their memories' larger contexts and experience
        a sense of empowerment to tell their own stories.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
        At MemoMio, we strive to provide a supportive and user-friendly platform for psychotherapy patients,
        enabling them to work towards their therapy goals in partnership with their therapist.
        We are passionate about making a positive impact on people's lives,
        and we hope that our application can help patients gain new perspectives on their own biography
        and begin to question their behavioral patterns.
